# hello-world
my beginning on github
I would prefer to remain anonymous for now, as I am a beginner and want to be able to learn and practice in peace. I just prefer this and there aren't any reasons I require to be anonymous, however I enjoy it. This is my first edit to a main branch.

Edited: edit due to practice and learning how to use github
